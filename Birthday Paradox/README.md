## Description

In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday.

## Program

The program allows the user to input the size of the set of randomly chosen people n and returns the probability that at least two people share a birthday. Assumes 365 days in a year (aka no leap years).
